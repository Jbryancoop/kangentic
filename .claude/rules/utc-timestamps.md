# Rule: DB timestamps are UTC ISO 8601 strings

Timestamp columns are stored as UTC ISO 8601 text. SQLite's `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` emits
`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` with no `Z` suffix, which JavaScript parses as local time, not UTC,
silently shifting every displayed time by the machine's offset.

## The rule

Write timestamp columns (`TEXT` columns like `created_at`, `updated_at`, `archived_at`,
`started_at`, `exited_at`) via `new Date().toISOString()`.

- Never use SQLite `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`.
- Never use naive strings like `new Date().toString()`.
- Display formatting is the renderer's job (`src/renderer/lib/datetime.ts`). The DB holds UTC
  instants only.

## Enforcement (self-maintaining)

- **Review:** the `migration-safety` agent checks schema-to-type alignment and timestamp
  handling on changes to `src/main/db/migrations.ts` and the repositories.
- No dedicated mechanical test yet. A migration scan for `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` and a
  repository scan for `toISOString()` on timestamp writes are candidate future tests; flag this
  gap if you add timestamp columns.

## Scope

Database writes under `src/main/db/`. Does not govern in-memory timestamps or renderer display
formatting.
