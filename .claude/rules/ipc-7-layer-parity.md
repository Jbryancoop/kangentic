# Rule: an IPC endpoint must be wired through all 7 layers

The renderer talks to the main process through a 7-layer bridge. An endpoint added to some
layers but not others fails at runtime (missing handler), at type-check (missing type), or
silently in tests (missing mock). All seven must stay in sync.

## The rule

When you add or change an IPC endpoint, wire it through every layer:

1. **Channel constant** in `src/shared/ipc-channels.ts` (single source of truth).
2. **Types** on the `ElectronAPI` interface in `src/shared/types.ts`.
3. **Preload** bridge in `src/preload/preload.ts` (`contextBridge`).
4. **Handler** in `src/main/ipc/handlers/*.ts` (`ipcMain.handle`), guarded with
   `!mainWindow.isDestroyed()` for push events and filtered by `projectId` where relevant.
5. **Service / repository** the handler delegates to.
6. **Store** consumer in `src/renderer/stores/*-store.ts` (the Zustand IPC bridge).
7. **Mock** in `tests/ui/mock-electron-api.js` so UI tests exercise the new surface.

The `add-ipc-endpoint` skill scaffolds all seven layers; the `ipc-bridge` skill is the full
checklist with the invoke vs send vs push-event patterns.

## Enforcement (self-maintaining)

- **Review:** the `ipc-auditor` agent cross-references all seven layers after changes to any IPC
  layer file.
- **Skills:** `add-ipc-endpoint` and `ipc-bridge` encode the layering.
- No single mechanical test spans all seven layers; `ipc-auditor` is the enforcement.

## Scope

The IPC bridge between renderer and main. Direct main-process-internal calls and renderer-only
state are not IPC and are not subject to this rule.
