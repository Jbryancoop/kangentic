/**
 * Cross-platform directory move engine for project relocation.
 *
 * `moveDirectory` relocates a directory tree from `sourcePath` to
 * `destinationPath`. It prefers an atomic `rename` (instant, same-volume) and
 * falls back to a recursive copy when the destination is on a different volume
 * (the OS reports `EXDEV`). It deliberately does NOT delete the source after a
 * copy: the caller owns that decision so the source survives until the work
 * that depends on the new location has succeeded.
 *
 * Everything runs through `original-fs` (the unpatched Node `fs`, not
 * Electron's asar-aware patch) and via the async `fs.promises.*` API so the
 * main-process event loop stays responsive during a long copy. See
 * `src/main/git/original-fs.ts` for why the patched `fs` would EBUSY on a tree
 * containing `.asar` files (a project's `node_modules` can hold them).
