/**
 * Shared helpers for agent `onProjectRelocated` implementations.
 *
 * Several agents key per-project data (session transcripts, trust entries,
 * config tables) to the absolute project path, stored OUTSIDE the project
 * folder. When a Kangentic project is moved or renamed, that data is orphaned
 * and sessions stop resuming. Each adapter migrates its own stores in an
 * `adapters/<agent>/project-relocation.ts` module; these helpers cover the
 * mechanics every one of them shares, generalized from the Claude reference
 * implementation (`adapters/claude/project-relocation.ts`).
 *
 * Everything here is best-effort and non-destructive: directories are renamed
 * or merged (never deleted), shared files are backed up and written atomically,
 * and callers wrap each step in try/catch so a partial failure degrades to
 * today's behavior (orphaned data) rather than data loss or a failed relocation.
