/**
 * Per-session serial write queue.
 *
 * `pty.write` on Windows ConPTY is fire-and-forget; sustained large writes
 * can saturate the input pipe and reorder bytes. To avoid that, every
 * `enqueue` for a given session appends to a single buffer drained by one
 * loop that emits at most `chunkSize` bytes per tick, yielding via
 * `setImmediate` between chunks so libuv can flush the named pipe.
 *
 * Concurrent enqueues append to the same buffer, so byte order is FIFO
 * regardless of how many callers (user input, terminal-submit keystrokes, paste)
 * write to the same session at once. This is the invariant that prevents
 * bracketed-paste sequences from being fragmented by interleaved writes -
 * the regression that caused Ctrl+V truncation.
 *
 * The queue is also surrogate-pair-safe: chunks never split a JavaScript
 * UTF-16 surrogate pair, which would otherwise produce U+FFFD replacement
 * characters when node-pty UTF-8-encodes the chunk.
